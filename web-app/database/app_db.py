Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of relevant documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of training documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text.
