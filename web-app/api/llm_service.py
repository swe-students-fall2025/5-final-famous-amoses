CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION PRIORITIES (in order of importance):
1. MAJOR ALIGNMENT (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   The student's major is: "{major}"
   CRITICAL: Strongly prioritize courses that align with the student's declared major.
   - If major is "Computer Science": Prioritize CS courses (CSCI-UA courses) that fulfill major requirements.
     Focus on core CS requirements first, then CS electives that support the career path.
   - If major is "Mathematics": Prioritize Math courses (MATH-UA courses) that fulfill major requirements.
     Focus on core Math requirements first, then Math electives that support the career path.
   - If major is not specified or "Undeclared": Still consider major requirements if available, but balance with other factors.
   The student MUST complete their major requirements to graduate. Major alignment is more important than general interests.
   NOTE: It is acceptable to include courses from other majors/departments (e.g., Math courses for CS majors, CS courses for Math majors)
   when they directly support the student's interests or career path, AS LONG AS major requirements are still being prioritized and completed.

2. CAREER PATH ALIGNMENT (HIGH PRIORITY): 
   The student's intended career path is: "{career_path if career_path else "Not specified"}"
   Within the context of the student's major, prioritize courses that directly support this career path.
   For example:
   - If career path is "Software Engineering" and major is CS: prioritize Software Engineering, Web Development, 
     Database Design, Agile/DevOps, Applied Internet Technology, etc.
   - If career path is "AI/ML" or "Machine Learning" and major is CS: prioritize Predictive Analytics, 
     Data Management, Big Data Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.
   - If career path is "Data Science" and major is CS: prioritize Database Design, Predictive Analytics, 
     Data Management, Probability and Statistics, etc.
   - If career path is "Systems" and major is CS: prioritize Operating Systems, Computer Systems Organization, 
     Theory of Computation, etc.
   - If career path is "Cybersecurity" and major is CS: prioritize Introduction to Cryptography, etc.
   DO NOT recommend generic courses when career-specific courses within the major are available.

3. SIDE INTERESTS (MEDIUM PRIORITY):
   The student has expressed interest in: {", ".join(side_interests) if side_interests else "none specified"}
   Include 1-2 courses that align with these side interests to create a well-rounded schedule.
   IMPORTANT: If an interest requires courses from another major/department, DO NOT hesitate to recommend them.
   For example:
   - If interest is "Machine Learning" or "AI": Recommend relevant Math courses like Probability and Statistics (MATH-UA.0185),
     Linear Algebra (MATH-UA.0140), or Theory of Probability (MATH-UA.0333) even if the student is a CS major.
   - If interest is "Data Science": Recommend Math courses like Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc.
   - If interest is "Cryptography": Recommend relevant Math courses that support cryptography.
   - Cross-major courses that support interests are valuable and should be included when they directly support the interest.
   However, ensure that major requirements are still being prioritized and completed. Balance is key:
   prioritize major requirements first, but include cross-major courses when they directly support stated interests.
   If side interests are specified, make sure at least one recommended course connects to them.

4. Major Requirements: Prioritize remaining core requirements if applicable (already covered in priority #1)
5. Difficulty Balance: Mix easy (1-2), medium (3), and challenging (4-5) courses
6. Course Sequencing: Ensure logical progression and prerequisite satisfaction

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT recommend courses the student has already completed: {", ".join(completed_courses) if completed_courses else "None"}
- DO NOT recommend courses already planned for ANY semester (including previous semesters)
- The available courses list has already been filtered to exclude completed and planned courses
- Recommend 4-6 courses (aim for {target_credits_min}-{target_credits_max} total credits)
- All prerequisites are already satisfied (already filtered, but double-check)

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "courses": [
    {{
      "course_code": "CSCI-UA.0101",
      "title": "Introduction to Computer Science",
      "credits": 4,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation that specifically mentions how this course aligns with the career path '{career_path if career_path else "academic goals"}' and/or side interests {side_interests if side_interests else "general academic growth"}"
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Provide thoughtful reasoning for each recommendation that explicitly connects the course to the student's career path and interests. 
Each reasoning should clearly state WHY this course is relevant to their career goals and how it fits into their academic journey."""
